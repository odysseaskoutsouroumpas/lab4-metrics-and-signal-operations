# Lab 4 â€“ Metric Functions and Signal Operations

This repository includes Python scripts and plots related to the analysis and manipulation of discrete-time signals, as part of Lab 4 in the "Digital Radar Signal Processing" coursework.

## Contents

- Calculation of signal energy and power  
- Even and odd signal decomposition  
- Basic signal arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, scaling)  
- Visualization of each signal operation for validation

## Files

- `.py` files: contain the code for signal processing functions  
- `.png` files: generated plots for visual inspection

These resources help build a deeper understanding of how metric functions and signal operations apply to real-world digital signal processing scenarios.
